# Mileage-4castr

This project aims to predict the mileage of cars based on features - cylinders, displacement, hp, weight, acceleration, model, origin and name.
 
 
We shall look at several methods from simple to more complex models to increase accuracy. Some of these models are: 

- Simple Regression
- Multiple Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K-Means Clustering

The data was obtained from  [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG)
There were about six rows with incomplete information which I deleted before I converted it to a .csv file. 

I'm going to use Graphlab to help me with the implementation of these models.
